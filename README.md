Questions:
1.       Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project. 
2.       Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc)
3.       How would you explain to your grandmother what Availity does?


Answers:
1.  My proudest professional achievement so far is to have been a valuable contributor on a fraud services development team which was responsible for 
    maintaining and supporting our suite of crown jewel applications in one of the top banking institutions in the world. While there, I was responsible 
    for replacing libraries used by the applications that had been identified to contain vulnerablities with latest versions and refactoring/testing 
    associated code to ensure proper functionality and performance was not lost among other duties.
    
2.  I am currently reading a book titled "The Pragamatic Programmer" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. It is a nice book which offers insights into sound
    programming practices from a developers perspective (which the authors are) as opposed to a text book author or language designer. It also provides 
    carrer advice on how to manage projects and work well on a team.
    
3.  Availity makes products that allows the payments you make for health services to be easily transferred to the recipient through digital channels.
